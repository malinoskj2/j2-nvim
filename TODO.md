# Todo's

- [ ] improve aesthetics
- [ ] write my own flatmap/flatten functions to work on penlight list. Check to make sure it does not have em. Was not seeing them last time I was in their docs iirc.
- [ ] figure out what to do for debugging
- [ ] benchmark startup time vs other peoples config. address perf if needed
- [ ] audit plugins to see what makes sense to lazy-load, and configure lazy-loading where appropriate
- [ ] configure spelling checks (and associated diagnostics) in file types where appropriate. Maybe within comments in other source as well
